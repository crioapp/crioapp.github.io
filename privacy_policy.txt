### Notice to End Users
Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization account (e.g. your employer, supplier or client), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control.
If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organizations policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator’s organization, which may be different than this policy.
Administrators are able to:
* View and disclose content you created or uploaded on the account.
* Modify and take ownership of content you created/uploaded on the account.
* Require you to reset your account password;
* Restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
* Access information in and about your account;
* Access or retain information stored as part of your account;
* Install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations
In some cases, administrators can also:
* Restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
* Change the email address associated with your account;
* Change your information, including profile information;
* Restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information

Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. You will be notified if this happens.
If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, use your personal email address to register for or access the Services. If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile. Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.
Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.
